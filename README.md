# SBA-308A

This project serves to get Pokemon data from PokeAPI. Users will first be prompted to choose 1 of the 1025 possible Pokemon
that exist. Such a listing will be populated by an axios request to an API. After choosing a Pokemon, the user will be
presented with two possible sprite visualizations of the selected Pokemon. The user will also then be prompted to click a
button that will retrieve that Pokemon's stats. The stats will be displayed graphically, as a function will take a value
from the API and apply that value to a border's width to simulate the appropriate size of the value.
